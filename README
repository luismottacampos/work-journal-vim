The Work Journal VIM Bundle

This is a VIM extension implementing my Work Journal.

A Work Journal is a day-by-day document I use to keep track of what I did, what is still to be done, and what issues I had on the way. This is great if you happen to work for a company where the work-pace is frenetic and you're a control-freak like me.
